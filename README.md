# ConqueringTheMonsterProc
Repo to support the session: Conquering the Monster Proc - How to Combat Legacy Code

**Abstract:**
We all have that one monster stored procedure: incredibly complex and integral to the application. But performance has been getting worse, and now it can no longer be ignored. You finally got the green light to make improvements but upon opening the code, you realize there's a bigger problem: Where do you begin? Is a full rewrite is appropriate? Do you have enough time to resolve all the issues? Are there any easy fixes to improve performance? In this session, we'll answer these questions and more. By the end, you will leave with a smart plan of attack to conquer that monster proc.
